# predict-nba-shooters
## About
This project was inspired by the following [article](https://medium.com/push-the-pace/fact-or-fiction-is-college-free-throw-percentage-better-than-college-three-point-percentage-at-8c77a7e3f09a).

Using SQL queries, I determined the most "NBA-ready" three-point shooters from the NBA 2021 Draft Class based on their NCAA three-point and free-throw percentage. 
I recieved my player stats from the following: [NBA SQL](https://github.com/mpope9/nba-sql/releases/tag/v0.0.4), [basketball-reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/), [college basketball reference](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/), and [Statmuse](statmuse.com).
